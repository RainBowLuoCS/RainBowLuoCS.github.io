Hi, I’m Run Luo. I am currently a third-year Master student in Computer Technology at the University of Chinese Academy of Sciences (UCAS), supervised by Prof. [Min Yang](https://minyang.me/). I received my Bachelor's degree in Software Engineering from Huazhong University of Science and Technology (HUST) in 2023.  My research interests focus on Visual Tracking, Diffusion Model, Multi-modal Learning, and Large Language Models. I am currently exploring a unified omnimodal foundational model involving vision, audio, and text modalities, and I hope to see the model generate synergy and benefit from both generation and understanding, thereby extending the intelligence boundaries of existing models. I firmly believe that it can unify the paradigms of world models or vision-language-action models, and through this, benefit interactions across different physical devices and the real world.
