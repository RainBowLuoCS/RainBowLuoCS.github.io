Hi, I’m Haonan Zhang (张浩楠 in Chinese). I am currently a third-year Ph.D. student in Computer Science and Technology at the University of Electronic Science and Technology of China (UESTC), supervised by Prof. [Lianli Gao](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=zsm2dpYAAAAJ) and Prof. [Jingkuan Song](https://cfm.uestc.edu.cn/~songjingkuan/). 
I received my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science and Technology from Xidian University in 2020. That same year, I joined UESTC for a Master’s degree and later transferred to the Ph.D. program in 2022.
Currently, I am also a visiting Ph.D. student at the Multimedia and Human Understanding Group (MHUG), University of Trento (Italy), supervised by Prof. [Nicu Sebe](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=stFCYOAAAAAJ&hl=en).

My research interests focus on Multi-modal Learning, LLMs. I am currently exploring the exciting and fast-growing field of Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models as part of my recent research.

For more information, please see my [CV](https://zchoi.github.io/assets/cv_haonanzhang.pdf).
